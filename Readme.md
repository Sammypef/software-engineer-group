Greetings for the TA or Instructor
Nonetheless, Welcome to Our Git REPO (not that party game on Steam)
This Project is part of the CPE334 Subject: Software Engineering. To understand the Principles and techniques used to create functionally correct, easy-to-use, robust, reliable, and maintainable software systems. Phases of the software development lifecycle, focusing on practical approaches. Team-based collaborative term project that requires students to analyze a proposed software system and produce a set of development artifacts typical of a real-world software development project.
In this case, we are doing webapp called "lyriclingo" which Let user learning multiples languages via songs with gamification (guess what it's referenced). 

P.S. Right now, the repo's contributions are just me (Sl1myz) because of the .env accident that we have to rewrite the entire git history with a tool to bulk.
